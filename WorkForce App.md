  ### The Combined Dashboard StructureEach user sees your five main tabs, but the content inside those tabs changes based on their title.

  #### 1\. Schedule (The "Who & When")

* Store Manager: Sees the "Master Schedule" for the whole shop. Can drag-and-drop shifts and approve time-off.  
* Assistant/Department Manager: Sees only their department's shift (e.g., just the Sales floor or just the Technicians).  
* Associate: Only sees their own personal schedule and a "Trade Shift" button.

  #### 2\. Analytics (The "How are we doing?")

* District Manager: Sees Comparative Analytics (Store A vs. Store B).  
* Store Manager: Sees Performance Analytics (Labor cost % vs. Revenue).  
* Department Manager: Sees Efficiency Analytics (How fast are services being completed?).

  #### 3\. Clients (The "Who are we serving?")

* Owner/Manager: Sees high-level data like "Customer Lifetime Value" and total database size.  
* Sales/Service Leads: See a "Pipeline" or "Active Jobs" list to ensure no client is forgotten.  
* Associates: See individual "Client Profiles" with notes so they can provide personalized service when the client walks in.

  #### 4\. Services (The "What are we doing?")

* Store Manager: Can edit the "Service Menu" and prices.  
* Department Manager: Manages the technical details—assigning specific specialists to specific service types.  
* Associate: Sees the "Service Guide" or "SOP" (Standard Operating Procedure) for how to perform the job correctly.

  #### 5\. Profile & Settings (The "Access Control")

- Owner/District Manager: Can "Merge" positions here. (e.g., Toggle a switch that gives the *Store Manager* access to *District-level Analytics*).

- Customize : Visual Branding (The Look)

The owner needs to make the app "feel" like their company.

* Custom Logo & App Icon: The ability to upload their own logo for the loading screen (splash screen) and the top of the dashboard.  
* Color Palette Control: Toggles to change the primary and secondary colors (e.g., changing your "SecureCert Blue" to a "Construction Orange").  
* Custom Domain (URL): Instead of using `yourplatform.com/clientname`, they use `app.clientbusiness.com`.  
* Font Selection: A choice between a few professional fonts that match their existing brand.

  ### 2\. Branded Communication (The Voice)

Every time the app "talks" to an employee or client, it should come from the business, not from you.

* Custom Email SMTP: System emails (like password resets or "AI Offer" notifications) come from `support@thebusiness.com`.  
* Whitelabel SMS: Automated texts for schedules or alerts appear with the business name as the sender.  
* "Powered By" Removal: The option to remove your company's name from the footer of the app.

  ### 3\. The "Tier Vault" Customization (The Content)

Since you are focusing on certifications and industry-specific work, the owner needs to "teach" the AI their world.

* Custom Document Labels: The ability to define what a "Cert" is (e.g., one business tracks "CLEET Licenses," another tracks "Food Handlers Permits").  
* Industry-Specific AI Training: A setting where the owner tells the AI, *"I am a Security Firm"* or *"I am a Laundromat."* This changes the tone of the AI Analysis Summary.  
* Custom Terms of Service: Allowing the business to upload their own legal disclosures for their employees.

  ### 4\. Administrative Controls (The Power)

* Role Mapping (The "Merge" Feature): A dashboard for the owner to create their own custom titles and assign the permissions we discussed (Schedule access, Analytics access, etc.).  
* Feature Toggling: If a small business doesn't need the "Services" tab, they should be able to turn it off entirely to keep their UI simple.  
* Client Database Ownership: A way for the owner to export all their CRM data at any time, ensuring they "own" their clients.
